# Solo Agreement

This assignment was initially done as a group. However, being on the self-paced track I am working as a solo developer. Here is a link where I asked ChatGPT to modify the questions to better fit a solo developer. [Link](https://chat.openai.com/share/2720c6b4-c2e7-464a-95f5-dc04912f20a3)

## Cooperation Plan (Solo Developer)

### Self-assessment
    
* Identify your key strengths as a developer.
* Consider how to best utilize these strengths in the project execution.

My strengths are growth and curiosity and I want to use these to help me come up with an idea I am genuinely excited about.

### Professional Growth

* Reflect on the competencies you want to further develop.
* Plan how you will focus on enhancing these skills throughout the project.

I want to work on confidence and being agile with the code I write. I feel a bit clunky and doubtful with some of my decisions, and want to be better at failure so that I can learn faster.

### Day-to-Day Approach

* Outline your daily work routine.
* Ensure you're not dominating the project individually but embracing diverse ideas.

I've been adjusted my work schedule to be less and less as I get closer to finishing up this module and preparing for the in-person classes. Starting March my schedule will open drastically allowing me to focus on this project.

**My Ideal Schedule:** 

* Wake up 5-6 am
* Breakfast 6-7 am
* Work 7-9:30 am
* Walk/Workout 9:30 - 11 am
* Lunch 11-12 pm
* Work 12-3 pm
* Walk/Break 3-4 pm
* Work 4-7 pm
* Dinner 7-8 pm
* Work 8-9 pm
* Relax 9-10 pm
* Bed 10:30


## Conflict Plan (Solo Developer)

### Conflict Resolution

* Describe your approach to resolving conflicts with yourself (e.g., disagreements in project direction).

The best thing I can do is to see every issue as a learning experience, take some time to step away, and also be light-hearted in knowing this all to better by ability of being a proficient engineer.

### Skill Level Variations

* Acknowledge any gaps in understanding and skill level
* Plan how to address these gaps through self-learning or seeking external resources.

I think I lack some skill in React and managing state. I can also struggle with CSS, but I do feel better than I did in the previous module, so I'm happy to see progress.

### Self-Reflection

* Consider how you will assess your own contributions objectively.
* Set criteria for when to adjust your approach if necessary.

I will try to stick to the user stories as good as possible, and try to experience the application from that lens. Not from what I just want it to be, but what I think real users would think about my project. Then listen to those who have tested it, and then adjust accordingly.

## Communication Plan (Solo Developer)

### Communication Platforms

* Specify the communication tools you will use (e.g., Slack, email)

I will use Slack and Remo. 

### Breaks and Catching Up:

* Plan for short breaks during work hours.
* Outline your strategy for catching up if you fall behind schedule.

I have planned for breaks in my schedule, and I have fallen behind a bit already and my strategy for this will be to adjust my ideal finished project closer to the minimum viable project.

### Ensuring Voice is Heard

* Set reminders to periodically review and reflect on your work.
* Encourage yourself to speak up when you have doubts or ideas.

### Creating a Safe Environment

* Acknowledge the importance of self-feedback.
* Strive to maintain a comfortable and productive working environment.

## Work Plan (Solo Developer)

### Task Management

* Describe your strategy for identifying, assigning, and tracking tasks.

As projects become more advanced in terms of features and implementations, I want to make sure I plan everything out well, and make a really useful Trello board.

### Project Management Tool 

* Specify the project management tool you'll use for organizing tasks (e.g., Trello, Jira).

I will use Trello as the PM tool.

## Presentation Deck (Solo Developer)

### Create Presentation Deck

* Develop a presentation deck following the provided [template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NeXKKEpjK2DDme8EwlZBsJndUqIgGYzWrY6FAYtNTf0/edit?pli=1#slide=id.g2accd1c413_3_31).

### Practice Session

* Schedule a practice run with your instructor as a preparation for the actual presentation.

## Git Process (Solo Developer)

### GitHub Components

* Determine which parts of your project will be hosted on GitHub.

Repo's will be on GitHub

### Repository Sharing

* Decide how you'll manage and share your repository with yourself (branching, version control).

I will make a main branch, 1 dev branch, and feature branches using the Trello board with user stories.

### Git Workflow

* Define your Git workflow for solo coding tasks.

My workflow will consist of creating a new feature branch, writing code, testing, debugging, then pushing to the development branch. As the development branch begins to have multiple features that don't have any bugs I can push them into main. As I continue to create or update features, I will do so in the dev branch, that way the user doesn't experience the same bugs.
